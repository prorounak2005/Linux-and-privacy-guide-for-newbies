## Introduction
This is a guide made for linux newbies. To make them comfortable with linux. You are free to open issue if you have any question regarding this topic.

### What is linux? 
Before installing linux it is always good to know what linux is. If you are not interested about it you can skip this part. 

---

Linux is the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). The linux operating system which we usually use is comprised of [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)+[LINUX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)).
So basically Linux is the kernel whereas the GNU is the extensive collection of free software and thats why many people call it (GNU+LINUX). Here is the link to the copypasta which many people use in linux forums and linux community - https://paste.rs/k0F


#### Linux Distributions 
[Linux Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) or linux distros are different operating systems with different collections of
software / [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) / [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment)(which we will cover in the next topic) but all linux distributions have one thing in common. They <strong>use the same [linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). </strong>. There are many linux distros out there but the ones I recommend are - 

* [Linuxmint](https://linuxmint.com/) - Linux mint was my first linux distro :) I highly recommend you to use this one.
* [Kde neon](https://neon.kde.org/)
* [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) - Just [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) with Kde desktop environment (ubuntu uses GNOME Desktop environment). See the [Desktop environment](#desktop-environments) topic.
* [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)

#### Desktop environments
[Desktop environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) are graphical user interfaces with their own set of apps (like notepad,calculator file managers). There are many desktop environments in linux, different desktop environment have different [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) they also have a different look and feel. 

There are many desktop environments in linux and the most popular ones are - 

* [Kde Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)  {Kde is an international free software community and they made the plasma Desktop environment}
* [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=292) 
* [Gnome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME)
* [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce)

## Installing linux operating system 
Installing linux operating system is very easy and not that complicated. Many people say that most of the stuff doesn't work on linux, thats really not true but yeah some stuff (like some games, some video editing software) doesn't work on linux. Don't worry because I am going to give you some [free and open source alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) to the [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) video editors you often use in windows and trust me these video editors are lot better than the video editors you used in windows. We will discuss it in details in this topic. Nowadays many games like ( Rust, Apex legends, csgo) specially the steam games runs on linux. Many big companies like [Valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation) , [Code Weavers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWeavers) have made tremendous changes over the past few months, allowing Linux to truly become a viable platform for gaming. Further, more and more indie development teams strive to use cross-platform rendering engines in order to have their game able to compile and run on Linux. You can go to [Proton Db](https://www.protondb.com/) to see which games can run on linux.

### Installing a distribution
First thing you want to do is to choose a linux distribution. Don't worry, installation steps will be same for all linux distributions. In this case I am going to use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) you can use other distribtions if you like.

#### Prerequisites

To install linux on you pc you need 

* Download the [.iso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_image) file from the linux distributions official website. In this case - https://linuxmint.com/download.php ( Make sure to download the cinnamon edition :) )
* You need a Pen drive of at least 4 or 8 gb 
* You have to flash the .iso file of the linux distribution you downloaded to your pendrive ( you have to make a bootable pendrive) for this you have to install a program knows as [Balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). I recommend balena because it is available for mac , windows and linux and it is very very simple to use unlike [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) (which you can also use if you want but it is only available for windows).
* When you will install balena etcher and open it, it will look like this - 
       <h2 align="center"> <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0iJF1KJ.png"> </h2> 

* Make sure your pendrive is plugged in and then select the `Flash from file` option. Then select the iso file of the linux distro you downloaded.
* Then click on `Select Target` option and then select your pendrive. 

<strong><bold>‚ùóWARNING: Don't select your hard drive or ssd because doing that will remove everthing from your system including your operating system. Balena etcher already gives us a warning when a user tries to choose any system drives. Make sure to choose your pendrive and not your system drive </bold></strong>
 
 <strong><bold>üìúNOTE: Before flashing your pendrive make sure to backup everything on your pendrive as everything in your pendrive will be removed!!</bold></strong>

* Then click on `Flash` and wait for it to complete.

* You have sucessfully installed linux on your pendrive :D 

#### Booting from you USB Pendrive
Now that you have installed linux in a pendrive. To install linux you have to boot from your pendrive but by default your computer will boot from your HDD/SSD. So to boot from your usb temporarily - 

* Reboot your pc 
* When you see the brand of your motherboard / when the computer switches on after shutting down you need to to press a key to acess your boot menu. [Here is the chart](https://www.disk-image.com/faq-bootmenu.htm) which lists the boot menu of different computer brands and laptops. Make sure to press(hold) that button as soon as your computer immediately turns on. 
* Now you will see a boot menu screen. You will be able to see your pendrive name. If you have [UEFI BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) you will see two options. One with "UEFI  <i>your_pendrive_name</i>" and another one will only be your pendrive name. Make sure to choose "UEFI  <i>your_pendrive_name</i>" with up and down arrows and press `ENTER/RETURN` key on your keyboard to boot from it. If you have  [OLD BIOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) you will only see your pendrive name. Make sure to choose that and then press enter. 
* UEFI BIOS uses [GPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table) whereas BIOS uses [MBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) to know more about these I recommend you to read this articles - 
  * https://www.maketecheasier.com/differences-between-uefi-and-bios/
  * https://www.maketecheasier.com/differences-between-mbr-and-gpt/
* Now [there will be several options on your screen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/LM_18_Cinnamon_Bootup_Live_CD.png) make sure to select `Start Linux MInt` option and press enter. 
* Congrats !!!! You now booted into linux mint :D

### Installation 

* Hold on ! You havent installed linux mint yet. It is running through your pendrive so to install linux mint onto your pc (Hard Drive/SSD) you [have to double click on `install linux mint` cd](https://www.how2shout.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Linux-Mint-Live-installation-option.jpg) which is visible on your desktop. Opening it will automatically open the linux mint installer.
* Now A welcome screen will be shown like this - 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2Otz2wu.png">

* Select your preffered language and click on `Continue`
* Then choose your keyboard layout. Default is `English (US)` and click on `Continue`
* Tick the checkbox on `Install multimedia codecs` and then click on continue.
---
#### Partitioning
* Now the most important part <strong> Partitioning </strong> - 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oPgob4v.png">

* If you have windows or another operating system installed in your pc you will get the option to run windows and linux mint side by side. Basically you boot into both the operating systems if you want. See [Multibooting/Dualbooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting) for more info. I recommend you to use this one because you should get your feet wet first before jumping into a sea, like I did :) and I am a full time linux user. I don't use windows / mac now. :)
* Second option is  <bold><strong>`Erase disk and install linux mint`</bold></strong> - Self explanatory. It will remove everything including your old operating system.
* <bold><strong>Something else</bold></strong> - If you want to manually partition your disk. See the [Example layouts](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide#Example_layouts) to get an idea if you want to partition your disk.
  * For people using old bios (LEGACY BIOS) I recommend you to watch this video - https://youtu.be/zuEmhXfBftI (Not the best youtube tutorial ik but still it is ok) 
  *  For people with UEFI BIOS follow these steps -
     * To make [efi partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFI_system_partition) click on [`New partition table`](https://i.imgur.com/ZpyD3Wx.png) option
     * Click on continue
     * [Select the `Free Space`](https://i.imgur.com/fytQXsQ.png)
     * [Click on the plus button below](https://i.imgur.com/WLNOjCB.png)
     * A window will show up
     * Make sure you click the `Primary` button
     * In the Size button make sure to make it to `512 MB` and under the `Use as` option select `EFI` option or something like that and then click on `ok`
     * and then follow the same video https://youtu.be/zuEmhXfBftI
---
* Now select your timezone. Your default timezone will automatically show up. If it doesn't click on the map ( in the region / state where you live) and then click on continue. 
* Type you name ( You can do it yourself :D ) 
* Type your password-

<strong><bold>üìúNOTE: Linux is secure because it prompts for a passwords everytime user tries to install software or do some admin stuff "for security reasons". You can click on `Login automatically` option which will log you in automatically but you will still need the password because your pc will prompt for the password when you will try to do stuff which requires admin priveledges ( for ex - installing/removing software , editing system files etc etc.) so dont forget the password. </strong></bold>

* Now wait for the system to install everything for you :)
* And then you will prompted with a window where it will ask you to reboot your pc. Reboot it.
* After rebooting immediately remove the pendrive from your computer because if you don't remove the pendrive you will again boot from your pendrive into the [live environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_CD). You don't want that because you just installed linux mint into your HDD/SSD.
* Congrats! You installed linux. FREEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOM!! :)
Now you should get a option to boot into linux as well as windows. :) (If you are dualbooting).

## Using Linux

### Installing graphics driver
After rebboting into you new linux machine you will be greeted with cinnamon desktop environment. It looks like windows isn't it ? :) . You can press your windows key ( in linux we call it "super key") to open linux mint menu. After opening that search for `Driver Manager` and click on it to open it. If it says that `Your computer does not need any additional drivers` you can skip this part. If you use nvidia you will see `open source drivers` and `proprietary drivers`. I will always recommend `proprietary drivers` because it is better than the `open source` [nouveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouveau_(software)) drivers. Click on `apply changes`. It will take time to install your drivers, and then a prompt may show up saying that you need to restart your pc. Click on `yes` and reboot. Now you have to [update your pc](#Updating-your-pc)

### Updating your pc 

It is important to update your pc. To update your pc press the windows key / super key and then search for `Update Manager`. Then apply the update. Updating your pc will take time. Then reboot you pc. You can also update through command line by opening terminal and typing  "`sudo apt update`" which will check the repository and will show the list of apps which needs to be updated. Play close attention to the terminal and don't ignore the messages. If it says that everything is up to date or all package are up to date then close your terminal. If it says that there are upgradable packages you have to upgrade/install them by typing `sudo apt upgrade`. After installing the update it is <bold><strong>very important</bold></strong> to reboot your pc.

### Installing softwares
Installing software is very very easy in linux. Press the windows key and search for `Software Manager` and open it. Search for the software you want to install and click on install. Give your password and wait for it to finish install and then open the application :) 
Another way is to do it through the terminal - 
* `sudo apt search <i>name_of_the_application</i>`
It will show the name of the application and whether is it there in your [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) and then do - 
* `sudo apt install <i>name_of_the_application</i>`
Done !!. 

Linux mint uses apt [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) so it is important to know about your package manager. You can type `apt --help` in the terminal which show list of things which your package manager can do for you.

### Removing softwares
To remove software - 
* Search for the software in the applications menu. Right click on the applcation and `uninstall`
* Open your `Software Manager` search for the software and uninstall.
* Open your terminal and run these commands -
  * `sudo apt remove <i>your_Application_name</i>` - Which removes the application but their configuration files and important settings will still remain on your pc. I don't recommend you to run this command.
  * `sudo apt purge <i>your_Application_name</i>` - Remove the applications , their configuration files and important settings. I use this command :)

## Gaming 
Now that you are familiar with linux. Now you want to play some games on linux. Lemme be honest here. Not all games run on linux. All the games you play use some called as [Anti-Cheat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Anti-cheat_software) which prevents cheater from cheating. Many companies who make these anti cheats don't support linux. Which means you cannot play it only on windows. If u are a gamer the best operating system probably for you will be windows for now but windows and mac are [proprietary / closed-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) operating system which means no one cannot read its [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) whereas linux is free and open source. My main reason in making this guide was to make people use free and open source operating systems which does no spy on you!! You have many options to game on linux- 

### Steam
Many steam games run on linux. To install steam on ur pc follow these steps - 
  
  * [Install](#Installing-softwares) steam on you pc and then open your steam client.
  * And then click on steam on the top left corner of your steam client - 
    
    <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I2x2K1a.png"></h2>


  * Then go to [Steam > settings](https://i.imgur.com/jD643KN.png) - 
  * Then go to the Steam play section 
  * Make sure you check the tick box on `Enable steam play for supported titles`
  * Under the advanced tab make sure you tick the checkbox for `Enable steam play for all other titles`. In the `Run other titles with` drop down menu. Make sure to choose the latest proton version. Steam uses [Steam proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton) a [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) of [wine](https://www.winehq.org/) both wine and proton can run windows games in linux.
   <h2 align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ncrFrCM.png"></h2>

Now you are ready to install your favorite games on steam. Go to [Proton db](https://www.protondb.com/) and search for your favorite games to see whether it is available or not. 
    
   
   * <bold>üìú NOTE:Wine/Proton are not emulators <strong><bold>WINE</strong></bold> stands for ( <strong><bold>W</strong></bold>ine <strong><bold>Is</strong></bold> <strong><bold>N</strong></bold>ot an <strong><bold>E</strong></bold>mulator)</bold> 
   
      
   
   * If you want to know more about wine ( and on how it works ) read this article on wikipedia - . If you want to know more about wine read this article on wikipedia - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)


### Wine

Most of the steam games can run on linux through Steam proton. But for non steam games you have to use [wine](https://www.winehq.org/).
  * To install wine in linux mint open you terminal and Run these following commands one by one and paste it in the terminal. 
    ```
    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
    wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
    sudo mv winehq.key /usr/share/keyrings/winehq-archive.key
    wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/dists/focal/winehq-focal.sources
    sudo mv winehq-focal.sources /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable
    #https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu
    
    ```
This is how you can install wine in any ubuntu/debian systems. Linux mint already have wine in their apt repository but the wine package they have is very old. So thats why you have go through these commands to install wine. This guide is only for Ubuntu and Debian based systems. If you want to install wine on  other linux distributions you can do so by going to this website - https://wiki.winehq.org/Download and choosing the linux distributions from the list.

You have installed wine !!!!. So easy isn't it ? :) Now we will install a graphical frontend to wine ( like [lutris](https://lutris.net/) ) because wine doesn't have a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) which means you have to use terminal to install your favorite games, which will be a tiresome experience. So we have to install [lutris](https://lutris.net/) so that you can install your favorite games with a single click. To install lutris type these commands one by one into the terminal - 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lutris-team/lutris
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lutris

```
If you are using other linux ditro then read [this article by lutris](https://lutris.net/downloads)

You have installed lutris. :D Now you can login to different accout by click on the [connect button](https://i.imgur.com/Xovf4NJ.png)

<bold> <strong>üìú NOTE </strong>: Not all games run on linux. There are games ( like genshin impact and valorant ) which doesn't support linux (for now). They use "kernel level anticheat". A kernel‚Äìlevel anti‚Äìcheat driver is software that runs at the core of a computer's operating system and can detect if a player is using an unauthorized process to give them an unfair advantage in a video game by monitoring all applications running. This also prvents linux users from using windows [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Definitions) . There are many games which can run perfectly on a windows virtual machine. Installing virtual machines ( like [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine) ) is outside the scope of this topic. It is better to dualboot windows with linux. If you want to play games on virtual machines and interested to know about it then you have to [install KVM](https://youtu.be/ozYKkaVK0_A) and then you have to [watch this youtube video](https://youtu.be/KVDUs019IB8). You should also read this [arch wiki article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PCI_passthrough_via_OVMF) </bold>

## Productivity

### Office-suites
Instead of using Microsoft Office you can use a program called as [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/) which has a suite of applications like microsoft office has. Such as- 
* Libreoffice writer - Word processor 
* Libreoffice Base - Database Development
* Libreoffice calc - For spreadsheets
* Libreoffice Impress - For presentations
* Libreoffice Draw - For drawing 
* Libreoffice Math - A formula editor

There are other alternatives to libreoffice to. Such as - [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) , [open office](https://www.openoffice.org/) . 
I personally recommend Libreoffice because it is better in my opinion as compared to other office suites. You can [easily install it](#Installing-softwares) in linux mint.

### Editing softwares
